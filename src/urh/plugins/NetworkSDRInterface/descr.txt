With this plugin you can interface external applications using TCP.
You can use your external application for performing protocol simulation on logical level or advanced modulation/decoding.
If you activate this plugin, a new SDR will be selectable:

 1. in protocol sniffer dialog
 2. in sending dialog.

 Furthermore, a new button below generator table will be created.
